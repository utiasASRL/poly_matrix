# PolyMatrix 

[![Python application](https://github.com/utiasASRL/poly_matrix/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/utiasASRL/poly_matrix/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

This repository contains functionalities to conveniently set up sparse symmetric matrices arising in semidefinite relaxations of polynomial optimization problems. The core functionality is demonstrated in `example.py`.

For more usage examples, check `_test/test_poly_matrix.py`.
